          <p>
            I know the heartbreak of a perfect take ruined by a noisy room.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I have spent the last 40 years as a musician. I play guitar, bass, drums, and keys. I know what it feels like when the inspiration strikes, you hit record, and the sound just isn't right.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But I have also spent the last 50 years in a different world. Coming from a family heritage of master craftsmen, I've spent my life in high-end remodeling and custom millwork. I've built luxury interiors for some of the most demanding clients in Florida.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For decades, these two lives—the Musician and the Builder—ran parallel. Then, I realized there was a gap in the market.

            The Gap:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Audio integrators know electronics but hate construction. General contractors know construction but think 'acoustics' just means gluing foam to a wall.
          </p>
          
          <p class="font-semibold text-text-primary">
            The Bridge:
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At JPC Unlimited, I bridge that gap. I use Chief Architect and CAD to design rooms with precise acoustic geometry. I use my millwork experience to build custom diffusers that look like art. And I use my background in audio engineering to ensure the final result is a room that disappears when the music starts.
          </p>

            I don't just renovate spaces. I tune them.
