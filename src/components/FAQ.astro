          How is this different from just hiring a contractor?
        </summary>
        <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Most contractors know construction, but they don't understand acoustics. Audio integrators know electronics, but they hate construction. I bridge that gap. I speak both languages—the language of load-bearing walls and permits, and the language of frequency response and decay time. Your room will sound as good as it looks.

      <details class="bg-bg-secondary rounded-lg border border-bg-tertiary">

          What does "Silent Shell" mean?
        </summary>
        <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            A Silent Shell is a room engineered for acoustic isolation. It's not just soundproofing—it's a complete system that prevents exterior noise from getting in, and prevents interior sound from getting out. It's the foundation of any great studio or listening room.

      <details class="bg-bg-secondary rounded-lg border border-bg-tertiary">

          Do I really need 3D rendering? Can't we just build it?
        </summary>
        <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            The 3D rendering isn't just about seeing what it looks like—it's about ensuring the acoustic geometry is correct before construction begins. It's much easier (and cheaper) to adjust angles and dimensions in a CAD file than to rebuild a wall. Plus, you'll be able to "walk through" your space before we start, so you know exactly what you're getting.

      <!-- FAQ Item 4 -->
      <details class="bg-bg-secondary rounded-lg border border-bg-tertiary">
        <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary hover:text-gold transition-colors">
          What's the typical timeline for a project?
        </summary>
        <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Timeline depends on the scope, but typically: Design phase (2-4 weeks), Build phase (6-12 weeks for most studios), and Tune phase (1-2 weeks). Complex projects can take longer, but you'll have a detailed timeline before we start.

      <details class="bg-bg-secondary rounded-lg border border-bg-tertiary">

          Can you work with existing rooms, or only new construction?
        </summary>
        <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-text-secondary">
          <p class="leading-relaxed">
            Both. I've transformed existing rooms into world-class studios, and I've designed and built from scratch. Every space is different, and every project is custom. Whether you're renovating a basement or building a new addition, we can make it work.
